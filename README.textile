h1. MacVimrc

My vim dotfiles (.vimrc, .givmrc) I use "MacVim":http://code.google.com/p/macvim/ on Mac OS X, but most of the settings should work with Linux or Windows versions of Vim.

Some stuff in the config files is related to the plugins I have installed (most of them are specific to Ruby on Rails development).

The colorscheme of my choice is "twilight":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1677.

h2. Installation

Put .vimrc and .gvimrc inside the user's home directiory. Then install "pathogen.vim":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332 and git clone the plugins to ~/.vim/bundle/ directory.

For Command-T after cloning to 'bundle' directory:

bc. cd ~/.vim/bundle/command-t
rake make
