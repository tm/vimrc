h1. MacVimrc

My vim dotfiles (.vimrc, .givmrc) I use "MacVim":http://code.google.com/p/macvim/ on Mac OS X, but most of the settings should work with Linux or Windows versions of Vim.

Some stuff in the config files is related to the plugins I have installed (most of them are specific to Ruby on Rails development).
