h1. vimrc

My vim dotfiles (.vimrc, .givmrc) I use for "MacVim":http://code.google.com/p/macvim/ on Mac.

Some stuff in the config files is related to the plugins I have installed (most of them are specific to Ruby on Rails and JavaScript development).

h2. Installation

`git clone https://github.com/tm/vimrc.git .vim` in your home directory.

h2. Keeping up to date

    cd ~/.vim
    git submodule foreach git pull origin master
