# vimrc


My vim dotfiles (.vimrc, .givmrc) I use for [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) on OS X.

Some stuff in the config files is related to the plugins I have installed (most of them are specific to Ruby on Rails and JavaScript development).

## Installation

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/tm/vimrc.git .vim` in your home directory.

## Keeping up to date

    cd ~/.vim
    git submodule foreach git pull origin master
